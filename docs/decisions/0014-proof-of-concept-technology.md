# 14. Proof Of Concept Technology Decision
Date: 04/12/2023
## Context and Problem Statement

What technology stack to use for the proof of concept to validate system architecture.

## Considered Options

* MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Next)
* .NET Blazor

## Decision Outcome

I considered using the MERN tech stack for its ease of use and lightweight boiler code, however It is a tech stack I am unfamiliar with and so would take time to adjust and produce a proof of concept with this.

On the other hand .NET Blazor is something that I am familiar with using and Is also relatively lightweight, I am also a lot more confident with C# as opposed to javascript and feel that the code structure can be represented a lot better using the C# .NET Blazor tech stack.

### Consequences

* A lightweight easy to setup demonstration of the system architecture.
* Easier time developing the proof of concept because of domain familiarity.
