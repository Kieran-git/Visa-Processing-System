# 3. What template to use for user stories
Date: 01/10/2023
## Context and Problem Statement

I need to decide on a conistent template to be used for creating user stories, this also refers to any more created as more requirements possibly appear later in the software's development life cycle.

## Considered Options

* More Simple template ![image](https://github.com/Kieran-git/SAD-Assessment-Visa-Processing-System/assets/64077345/420d3e3c-2a6b-42c9-829a-45933ca1b52f)

## Decision Outcome

I researched into possible templates to be used for the user stories in the project documentation and came to a choice between the more simple one which provided the minimum necessary information for a user story and then a more complex template including the risks and priority of the requirement.

However, I determined that in the end the more simple user story template was most approriate as the added information isn't necessary at this stage and can be added upon at another point in the documentation if needed.

### Consequences

* The chosen template is condense and layed out simply so that from a glance one can understand the requirement behind the user story.
