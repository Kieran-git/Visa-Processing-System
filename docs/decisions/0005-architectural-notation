# 5. What architectural notation to use
Date: 23/10/2023

## Context and Problem Statement

The type of notation that we will use to demonstrate the architecture of the system needs to be decided upon.

## Considered Options

* Pure C4 Notation
* Pure UML Notation
* A combination of both

## Decision Outcome

I considered either going with one notation or the other to demonstrate how my system will be layed out and how all of the component interact with each other. However, this has its limitations and I believe that in some aspects UML offers a better way of presenting my system and in other ways C4 does.

Therefore in conclusion I will be using the C4 notation with the 4 levels of abstraction going deeper into my system however within these context, container and component diagrams I want to have the opporutnity to use UML notation when most suitable.
The most sensible situation I beleive is in the component diagram as If I use an UML class diagram this can be easily implemented into my proof of concept with 1 to 1 mapping with the data types and functions, which is also very helpful as a piece of documentation.

### Consequences

* The chosen combination of using both allows a more flexible approach to demonstrating my system architecture.
* The documentation will be more useful for developers and in general all stakeholders by using simple to understand and apply notation.
