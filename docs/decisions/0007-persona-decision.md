# 7. Persona Decision
Date: 09/09/2023
## Context and Problem Statement

What range of users will be included in the system and what non-functional requirements will be born from this?

## Considered Options

* Cover basic users of the system with their functional requirements
* Cover basic users and unique accessiblity cases

## Decision Outcome

In order to give rise to non-functional requirements it was quite obvious that the personas need to also cover accessbility cases and so the created personas are all also tailored to represent common issues that affect people using software systems.

I have included things such as RSI and vision impairment which in turn forces the software system to be created with these things in mind driving a more enclusive overall software system.

### Consequences

* Choosing to include accessbility cases in the personas gives a clear indication of how the software system needs to be adapted to meet those needs.
* The system will reach a wider potential user audience.
