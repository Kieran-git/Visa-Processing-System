# 1. What documentation should applicants need to provide for a visa application
Date: 19/10/2023
## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide on the amount of identification that will be required to identify individuals in order to deny or accept their visa application. Identification consists of  (Drivers License, Passport, Birth Certificate, Adoption Certificate)

## Considered Options

* 1 kind of identification document
* 2 different kinds of identification documents 
* 3 different types of identification document

## Decision Outcome

We considered only one identification document as this greatly speeds up the process of getting the visa application completed in general however if this reached the visa authorities and was then denied this would be meaningless. 
On the other hand with three types of different documentation this would take significantly longer and so a medium ground with two different types of identification documentation was chosen. 

### Consequences

* With two different types of identification documents this provides absolute verification that it is that person applying for the visa.
* Also this doesnâ€™t compromise too much on the impact this has on the speed of processing the visa application overall.
