# 1. What documentation should applicants need to provide for a visa application
Date: 19/10/2023
## Context and Problem Statement

I need to decide on the types and amount of documetation that will be required for valid a visa application.

## Considered Options

* 1 type of identification (Passport, Birth certificate, Driver’s License, etc) and 1 type of proof of address (Utility bill, bank statement, tax documents, etc).
* 2 different types of each identication and proof of address
* 2 types of identifaction or proof of address

## Decision Outcome

I have considered only one identification document or proof of identication as this greatly speeds up the process of getting the visa application completed in general however if this reached the visa authorities and was then denied this would be meaningless. 
On the other hand two types of both a form of identification and proof of address could take far too long slowing down the application progress as most people will not have access to these documents.

Therefore a balance between requiring one type of identification and one type of proof of address should be sufficent in both proving that person is eligible and a reasonable processing time for the application.

### Consequences

* With this method we have absolute verification that the person is who they say they are and can confirm where they are coming from.
* Also this doesn’t compromise too much on the impact this has on the speed of processing the visa application overall.
