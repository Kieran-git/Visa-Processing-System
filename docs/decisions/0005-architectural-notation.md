# 5. What architectural notation to use
Date: 23/10/2023

## Context and Problem Statement

The type of notation that we will use to demonstrate the architecture of the system needs to be decided upon.

## Considered Options

* Pure C4 Notation
* Pure UML Notation
* A combination of both

## Decision Outcome

Pure UML notation is a good consideration as this is another industry standard however it tends to be more complex in nature and more rigid in nature as to what associations you need to represent entities with.

A pure C4 notation is very easy to read and you can clearly see how all of the components interact however one can also argue that the technicalities that come along with the UML notation are lost and a level of detail that UML achieves cannot be reached with C4 notation alone.

Therefore in conclusion I will be using the C4 notation with the 4 levels of abstraction going deeper into my system, within these stages I will use whatever notation fits that abstraction level best in order to demonstrate my system architecture.

### Consequences

* The chosen decision should allow a more flexible approach to demonstrating my system architecture.
* The documentation will be more useful for developers and in general all stakeholders by using simple to understand and apply notation.
