# 4. What part of the system will the wireframes cover
Date: 19/10/2023
## Context and Problem Statement

The part of the system that the wireframes will cover and demonstrate the workflow of needs to be decided upon.

## Considered Options

* Applicant's perspective
* Documentation Reviewer's perspective
* Administrator(National/International)'s perspective

## Decision Outcome

I considered producing the wireframes from several different perspectives of users on the system. By dealing with the Documentation Reviewer or Administrator this would show the main workflow for key staff members of AFS however it excludes one of the main reasons for the system being created and that is the applicants themselves.

In conclusion I chose to create the wireframes based on the Applicant's perspective of the system and how they will interact with this as it is what I conside the most important aspect of the system and is why the software solution is being developed in the first place.

### Consequences

* The chosen coverage for the wireframes will demonstrate the most important aspect of the system and will clearly show the workflow of how our system will make it easier for visa applications.
