# 2. What countries will be initailly covered for in the system
Date: 19/10/2023
## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide on the coverage for the system including from what countries will people be applying from and if we will initially cover multiple places to apply to.
For more visa applciation destinations this will result in more type of visas needing to be accounted for.

## Considered Options

* 3 Europe based countries applying from and 1 destination for visa application
* 3 globally separated countries applying from and 1 destination for visa application
* 2 globally separated countries applying from and 2 destination for visa applications

## Decision Outcome

Initially I considered to have 2 random countries from around the world for both applicants coming from and where they would be applying to however this would be quite a large amount of differing visa types when within just 1 country there exists many so I deemed this as unrealistic.
On the other hand dealing with just 1 visa destination still demonstrates the capacity for different types of visas as mentioned before there are many types and subtypes for just a single country.

In conclusion I chose to deal with applicants coming from Germany, Ukraine and France which are all European based which I felt was most appropriate when dealing with applications to the UK.

### Consequences

* The chosen coverage and scope will demonstrate the ability to handle a large amount of applicants and thus data, of which there is research to back this up (Ali, 2022).
* Including Ukraine in the chosen scope of countries is very relevant as of the moment because there is a large influx of people seeking immigration to other countries which requires a visa for long stays of residence.
